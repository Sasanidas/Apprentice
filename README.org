#+html: <blockquote> Elixir Tooling Integration Into Emacs </blockquote>

Apprentice is a fork [[https://github.com/tonini/alchemist.el][alchemist.el]], similar in some aspects but quite different in others.

Like alchemist, Apprentice comes with a bunch of *features*, which are:

+ Mix integration
+ Compile & Execution of Elixir code
+ Inline code evaluation
+ Powerful IEx integration
+ Elixir project management
+ Phoenix support

* Quickstart

** Installation

For now, you can install this package by adding the files to the emacs load-path.

# `package.el` is the built-in package manager in Emacs.

#  Apprentice.el is available on the two major `package.el` community maintained repos - [MELPA Stable](http://stable.melpa.org) and [MELPA](http://melpa.org).

#  You can install `Apprentice` with the following command: 

#  <kbd>M-x package-install [RET] apprentice [RET]</kbd>
